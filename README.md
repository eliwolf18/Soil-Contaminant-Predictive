ðŸŒ± Soil Contamination Predictive Tool

Overview

The Soil Contamination Predictive Tool is a data product designed to help environmental specialists quickly determine whether soil samples are contaminated based on input properties. It leverages a Machine Learning model trained on soil data to provide accurate predictions.

Features
	â€¢	Input soil properties (e.g., pH, Sand %, Clay %).
	â€¢	Predict whether the soil is Contaminated or Not Contaminated.
	â€¢	Displays the probability of contamination in an interactive progress bar.
	â€¢	User-friendly interface built with Dash.
	â€¢	Deployed using Render for easy accessibility.

How It Works
	1.	Enter soil properties such as:
	â€¢	Sand %, Clay %, Silt %, pH
	â€¢	Electrical Conductivity (EC), Organic Matter %, and more.
	2.	Click the Predict button.
	3.	View:
	â€¢	The contamination result.
	â€¢	The probability of contamination visually displayed in a progress bar.

Prerequisites
	â€¢	Python 3.8 or higher.
	â€¢	Required libraries (see requirements.txt).
